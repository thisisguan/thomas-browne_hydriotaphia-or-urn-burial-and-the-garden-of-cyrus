			<p>The Solemnities, Ceremonies, Rites of their Cremation or enterrment, so solemnly delivered by Authours, we shall not disparage our Reader to repeat. Only the last and lasting part in their Urns, collected bones and Ashes, we cannot wholly omit, or decline that Subject, which occasion lately presented, in some discovered among us.</p>
			<p>In a Field of old <i>Walsingham</i>, not many moneths past, were digged up between fourty and fifty Urnes, deposited in a dry and sandy soile, not a yard deep, nor farre from one another: Not all strictly of one figure, but most answering these described: Some containing two pounds of bones, distinguishable in skulls, ribs, jawes, thigh-bones, and teeth, with fresh impressions of their combustion. Besides the extraneous substances, like peeces of small boxes, or combes handsomely wrought, handles of small brasse instruments, brazen nippers, and in one some kind of <i>Opale</i>.<a href="#note1" id="b1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
			<p><a id="page15">Near</a> the same plot of ground, for about six yards compasse were digged up coals and incinerated substances, which begat conjecture that this was the <i>Ustrina</i> or place of burning their bodies, or some sacrificing place unto the <i>Manes</i>, which was properly below the surface of the ground, as the <i>Aræ</i> and Altars unto the gods and <i>Heroes</i> above it.</p>
			<p>That these were the Urnes of <i>Romanes</i> from the common custome and place where they were found, is no obscure conjecture, not farre from a <i>Romane</i> Garrison, and but five Miles from <i>Brancaster</i>, set down by ancient Record under the name of <i>Brannodunum</i>. And where the adjoyning Towne, containing seven Parishes, in no very different sound, but Saxon Termination, still retains the Name of <i>Burnham</i>, <!-- Burnham Deepside, Burnham Norton, Burnham Overy, Burnham Sutton, Burnham Thorpe, Burnham Ulph and Burnham Westgate--> which being an early station, it is not improbable the neighbour parts were filled with habitations, either of <i>Romanes</i> themselves, or <i>Brittains Romanised</i>, which observed the <i>Romane</i> customs.</p>
			<p>Nor is it improbable that the <i>Romanes</i> early possessed this Countrey; for though we meet not with such strict particulars <a id="page16">of</a> these parts, before the new Institution of <i>Constantine</i>, and military charge of the Count of the <i>Saxon</i> shore, and that about the <i>Saxon</i> Invasions, the <i>Dalmatian</i> Horsemen were in the Garrison of <i>Brancaster</i>: Yet in the time of <i>Claudius</i>, <i>Vespasian</i>, and <i>Severus</i>, we finde no lesse then three Legions dispersed through the Province of <i>Brittain</i>. And as high as the Reign of <i>Claudius</i> a great overthrow was given unto the <i>Iceni</i>, by the <i>Romane</i> Lieutenant <i>Ostorius</i>. Not long after the Countrey was so molested, that in hope of a better state, <i>Prastaagus</i><a href="#note2" id="b2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> bequeathed his Kingdome unto <i>Nero</i> and his Daughters; and <i>Boadicea</i> his Queen fought the last decisive Battle with <i>Paulinus</i>. After which time and Conquest of <i>Agricola</i> the Lieutenant of <i>Vespasian</i>, probable it is they wholly possessed this Countrey, ordering it into Garrisons or Habitations, best suitable with their securities. And so some <i>Romane</i> Habitations, not improbable in these parts, as high as the time of <i>Vespasian</i>, where the <i>Saxons</i> after seated, in whose thin-fill’d Mappes we yet finde the Name of <i>Walsingham</i>. Now if the <i>Iceni</i> were but <i>Gammadims</i>, <a id="page17"><i>Anconians</i>,</a> or men that lived in an Angle wedge or Elbow of <i>Brittain</i>, according to the Originall Etymologie, this countrey will challenge the Emphaticall appellation, as most properly making the Elbow or Iken of <i>Icenia</i>.<a href="#note3" id="b3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
			<p>That <i>Britain</i> was notably populous is undeniable, from that expression of <i>Cæsar</i>.<a href="#note4" id="b4"><sup>4</sup></a> That the <i>Romans</i> themselves were early in no small Numbers, Seventy Thousand with their associats slain by <i>Boadicea</i>, affords a sure account. And though many <i>Roman</i> habitations are now unknowne<a href="#note5" id="b5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>, yet some by old works, Rampiers, Coynes, and Urnes doe testifie their Possessions. Some Urnes have been found at <i>Castor</i>, some also about <i>Southcreake</i>, and not many years past, no lesse then ten in a Field at <i>Buxton</i>,<a href="#note6" id="b6"><sup>6</sup></a> not near any recorded Garison. Nor is it strange to finde <i>Romane</i> Coynes of Copper and Silver among us; of <i>Vespasian, Trajan, Adrian, Commodus, Antoninus, Severus</i>, &amp;c. But the greater number of <i>Dioclesian, Constantine, Constans, Valens</i>, with many of <i>Victorinus Posthumius, Tetricus</i>, and the Thirty Tyrants in the Reigne of <i>Gallienus</i>; and <a id="page18">some</a> as high as <i>Adrianus</i> have been found about <i>Thetford</i>, or <i>Sitomagus</i>, mentioned in the itinerary of <i>Antoninus</i>, as the way from <i>Venta</i> or <i>Castor</i> unto <i>London</i>.<a href="#note7" id="b7"><sup>7</sup></a> But the most frequent discovery is made at the two <i>Casters</i> by <i>Norwich</i> and <i>Yarmouth</i>,<a href="#note8" id="b8"><sup>8</sup></a> at <i>Burghcastle</i> and <i>Brancaster</i>.<a href="#note9" id="b9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
			<p>Besides, the <i>Norman, Saxon</i> and <i>Danish</i> peeces of <i>Cuthred, Canutus, William Matilda</i>,<a href="#note10" id="b10"><sup>10</sup></a> and others, som Brittish Coynes of gold have been dispersedly found; And no small number of silver peeces near <i>Norwich</i>;<a href="#note11" id="b11"><sup>11</sup></a> with a rude head upon the obverse, and an ill formed horse on the reverse, with Inscriptions <i>Ic. Duro. T.</i> whether implying <i>Iceni, Dutotriges, Tascia</i>, or <i>Trinobantes</i>, we leave to higher conjecture. Vulgar Chronology will have <i>Norwich</i> Castle as old as <i>Julius <a id="page19">Cæsar</a></i>; but his distance from these parts, and its <i>Gothick</i> form of structure, abridgeth such Antiquity. The <i>British</i> Coyns afford conjecture of early habitation in these parts, though the City of <i>Norwich</i> arose from the ruines of <i>Venta</i>, and though perhaps not without some habitation before, was enlarged, builded, and nominated by the <i>Saxons</i>. In what bulk or populosity it stood in the old East-angle Monarchy, tradition and history are silent. Considerable it was in the <i>Danish</i> Eruptions, when <i>Sueno</i> burnt <i>Thetford</i> and <i>Norwich</i>,<a href="#note12" id="b12"><sup>12</sup></a> and <i>Ulfketel</i> the Governour thereof, was able to make some resistance, and after endeavoured to burn the <i>Danish</i> Navy.</p>
			<p>How the <i>Romanes</i> left so many Coynes in Countreys of their Conquests, seems of hard resolution, except we consider how they buried them under ground, when upon barbarous invasions they were fain to desert their habitations in most part of their Empire, and the strictnesse of their laws forbidding to transfer them to any other uses; Wherein the <i>Spartans</i><a href="#note13" id="b13"><sup>13</sup></a> were singular, who to make their Copper money uselesse, contempered it with <a id="page20">vinegar.</a> That the <i>Brittains</i> left any, some wonder; since their money was iron, and Iron rings before <i>Cæsar;</i> and those of after stamp by permission, and but small in bulk and bignesse; that so few of the <i>Saxons</i> remain, because overcome by succeeding Conquerors upon the place, their Coynes by degrees passed into other stamps, and the marks of after ages.</p>
			<p>Then the time of these Urnes deposited, or precise Antiquity of these Reliques, nothing of more uncertainty. For since the Lieutenant of <i>Claudius</i> seems to have made the first progresse into these parts, since <i>Boadicea</i> was overthrown by the Forces of <i>Nero</i>, and <i>Agricola</i> put a full end to these Conquests; it is not probable the Countrey was fully garrison’d or planted before; and therefore however these Urnes might be of later date, not likely of higher Antiquity.</p>
			<p>And the succeeding Emperours desisted not from their Conquests in these and other parts; as testified by history and medall inscription yet extant. The Province of <i>Brittain</i> in so divided a distance from <i>Rome</i>, beholding the faces <a id="page21">of</a><a href="#note14" id="b14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> many Imperiall persons, and in large account no fewer then <i>Cæsar, Claudius, Britannicus, Vespasian, Titus, Adrian, Severus, Commodus, Geta</i>, and <i>Caracalla</i>.</p>
			<p>A great obscurity herein, because no medall or Emperours Coyne enclosed, which might denote the date of their enterrments. Observable in many Urnes, and found in those of <i>Spittle</i> Fields by <i>London</i>,<a href="#note15" id="b15"><sup>15</sup></a> which contained the Coynes of <i>Claudius</i>, <i>Vespasian</i>, <i>Commodus</i>, <i>Antoninus</i>, attended with Lacrymatories, Lamps, Bottles of Liquor, and other appurtenances of affectionate superstition, which in these rurall interrements were wanting.</p>
			<p>Some uncertainty there is from the period or term of burning, or the cessation of that practice. <i>Macrobius</i> affirmeth it was disused in his dayes. But most agree, though without authentick record, that it ceased with the <i>Antonini</i>. Most safely to be understood after the Reigne of those Emperours, which assumed the name of <i>Antoninus</i>, extending unto <i>Heliogabalus</i>. Not strictly after <i>Marcus</i>; For about fifty years later we finde the magnificent burning, and <a id="page22">consecration</a> of <i>Severus</i>;<a href="#note16" id="b16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> and if we so fix this period or cessation, these Urnes will challenge above thirteen hundred years.</p>
			<p>But whether this practise was onely then left by Emperours and great persons, or generally about <i>Rome</i>, and not in other Provinces, we hold no authentick account. For after <i>Tertullian</i>, in the dayes of <i>Minucius</i> it was obviously objected upon Christians, that they condemned the practice of burning.<a href="#note17" id="b17"><sup>17</sup></a> And we finde a passage in <i>Sidonius</i>,<a href="#note18" id="b18"><sup>18</sup></a> which asserteth that practise in <i>France</i> unto a lower account. And perhaps not fully disused till Christianity fully established, which gave the finall extinction of these sepulchrall Bonefires.</p>
			<p>Whether they were the bones of men or women or children, no authentick decision from ancient custome in distinct places of buriall. Although not improbably conjectured, that the double Sepulture or burying place of <i>Abraham</i>,<a href="#note19" id="b19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> had in it such intension. But from exility of bones, thinnesse of skulls, smallnesse of teeth, ribbes, and thigh-bones; not improbable that many thereof were persons of <i>minor</i> age, or women. <a id="page23">Confirmable</a> also from things contained in them: In most were found substances resembling Combes, Plates like Boxes, fastened with Iron pins, and handsomely overwrought like the necks or Bridges of Musicall Instruments, long brasse plates overwrought like the handles of neat implements, brazen nippers to pull away hair, and in one a kinde of <i>Opale</i> yet maintaining a blewish colour.</p>
			<p>Now that they accustomed to burn or bury with them, things wherein they excelled, delighted, or which were dear unto them, either as farewells unto all pleasure, or vain apprehension that they might use them in the other world, is testified by all Antiquity. Observable from the Gemme or Berill Ring upon the finger of <i>Cynthia</i>, the Mistresse of <i>Propertius</i>, when after her Funerall Pyre her Ghost appeared unto him.<a href="#note20" id="b20"><sup>20</sup></a> And notably illustrated from the Contents of that <i>Romane</i> Urne preserved by Cardinall <i>Farnese</i>,<a href="#note21" id="b21"><sup>21</sup></a> wherein besides great number of Gemmes with heads of Gods and Goddesses, were found an Ape of <i>Agath</i>, a Grashopper, an Elephant of Ambre, a Crystall Ball, three glasses, <a id="page24">two</a> Spoones, and six Nuts of Crystall. And beyond the content of Urnes, in the Monument of <i>Childerick</i> the first,<a href="#note22" id="b22"><sup>22</sup></a> and <a id="pharamond">fourth</a> King from <i>Pharamond</i>, casually discovered three years past at <i>Tournay</i>, restoring unto the world much gold richly adorning his Sword, two hundred Rubies, many hundred Imperial Coyns, three hundred golden Bees, the bones and horseshoe of his horse enterred with him, according to the barbarous magnificence of those days in their sepulchral Obsequies. Although if we steer by the conjecture of many and Septuagint expression; some trace thereof may be found even with the ancient Hebrews, not only from the Sepulcrall treasure of <i>David</i>, but the circumcision knives which <i>Joshua</i> also buried.</p>
			<p>Some men considering the contents of these Urnes, lasting peeces and toyes included in them, and the custome of burning with many other Nations, might somewhat doubt whether all Urnes found among us, were properly <i>Romane</i> Reliques, or some not belonging unto our <i>British</i>, <i>Saxon</i>, or <i>Danish</i> Forefathers.</p>
			<p>In the form of Buriall among the <a id="page25">ancient</a> <i>Brittains</i>, the large Discourses of <i>Cæsar</i>, <i>Tacitus</i>, and <i>Strabo</i> are silent: For the discovery whereof, with other particulars, we much deplore the loss of that Letter which <i>Cicero</i> expected or received from his Brother <i>Quintus</i>, as a resolution of <i>Brittish</i> customes; or the account which might have been made by <i>Scribonius Largus</i> the Physician, accompanying the Emperour <i>Claudius</i>, who might have also discovered that frugall Bit<a href="#note23" id="b23"><sup>23</sup></a> of the Old <i>Brittains</i>, which in the bignesse of a Bean could satisfy their thirst and hunger.</p>
			<p>But that the <i>Druids</i> and ruling Priests used to burn and bury, is expressed by <i>Pomponius</i>; That <i>Bellinus</i> the Brother of <i>Brennus</i>, and King of <i>Brittains</i> was burnt, is acknowledged by <i>Polydorus</i>, as also by <i>Amandus Zierexensis</i> in <i>Historia</i>, and <i>Pineda</i> in his <i>Universa historia</i>. Spanish. That they held that practise in <i>Gallia</i>, <i>Cæsar</i> expresly delivereth. Whether the <i>Brittains</i> (probably descended from them, of like Religion, Language and Manners) did not sometimes make use of burning; or whether at least such as were after civilized unto the <i>Romane</i> life <a id="page26">and</a> manners, conformed not unto this practise, we have no historicall assertion or deniall. But since from the account of <i>Tacitus</i> the <i>Romanes</i> early wrought so much civility upon the Brittish stock, that they brought them to build Temples, to wear the Gowne, and study the <i>Romane</i> Laws and language, that they conformed also unto their religious rites and customes in burials, seems no improbable conjecture.</p>
			<p>That burning the dead was used in <i>Sarmatia</i>, is affirmed by <i>Gaguinus</i>,<a href="#note24" id="b24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> that the <i>Sueons</i> and <i>Gothlanders</i> used to burne their Princes and great persons, is delivered by <i>Saxo</i> and <i>Olaus</i>; that this was the olde <i>Germane</i> practise, is also asserted by <i>Tacitus</i>. And though we are bare in historicall particulars of such obsequies in this Island, or that the <i>Saxons</i>, <i>Jutes</i>, and <i>Angles</i> burnt their dead, yet came they from parts where ’twas of ancient practise; the <i>Germanes</i> using it, from whom they were descended. And even in <i>Jutland</i> and <i>Sleswick</i> in <i>Anglia Cymbrica</i>, Urnes with bones were found not many years before us.</p>
			<p>But the <i>Danish</i> and Northern Nations <a id="page27">have</a> raised an <i>Æra</i> or point of compute from their Custome of burning their dead:<a href="#note25" id="b25"><sup>25</sup></a> Some deriving it from <i>Unguinus</i>, some from <i>Frotho</i> the great; who ordained by Law, that Princes and Chief Commanders should be committed unto the fire, though the common sort had the common grave enterrment. So <i>Starkatterus</i> that old <i>Heroe</i> was burnt, and <i>Ringo</i> royally burnt the body of <i>Harald</i> the King slain by him.<a href="#note26" id="b26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
			<p>What time this custome generally expired in that Nation, we discern no assured period; whether it ceased before Christianity, or upon their Conversion, by <i>Ausgurius</i> the Gaul in the time of <i>Ludovicus Pius</i> the Sonne of <i>Charles</i> the great, according to good computes; or whether it might not be used by some persons, while for a hundred and eighty years Paganisme and Christianity were promiscuously embraced among them, there is no assured conclusion. About which times the <i>Danes</i> were busie in <i>England</i>, and particularly infested this Countrey: Where many Castles and strong holds, were built by them, or against them, and great number of names and <a id="page28">Families</a> still derived from them. But since this custome was probably disused before their Invasion or Conquest, and the <i>Romanes</i> confessedly practised the same, since their possession of this Island, the most assured account will fall upon the <i>Romanes</i>, or <i>Brittains Romanized</i>.</p>
			<p>However certain it is, that Urnes conceived of no <i>Romane</i> Originall, are often digged up both in <i>Norway</i>, and <i>Denmark</i>, handsomely described, and graphically represented by the Learned Physician <i>Wormius</i>,<a href="#note27" id="b27"><sup>27</sup></a> And in some parts of <i>Denmark</i> in no ordinary number, as stands delivered by Authours exactly describing those Countreys.<a href="#note28" id="b28"><sup>28</sup></a> And they contained not only bones, but many other substances in them, as Knives, peeces of Iron, Brasse and Wood, and one of <i>Norwaye</i> a brasse guilded Jewes-harp.</p>
			<p>Nor were they confused or carelesse in disposing the noblest sort, while they placed large stones in circle about the Urnes, or bodies which they interred: Somewhat answerable unto the Monument of <i>Rollrich</i> stones in <i>England</i>,<a href="#note29" id="b29"><sup>29</sup></a> or sepulcrall Monument probably erected by <i>Rollo</i>, who after conquered <i>Normandy</i>. <a id="page29">Where</a> ’tis not improbable somewhat might be discovered. Mean while to what Nation or person belonged that large Urne found at <i>Ashburie</i>,<a href="#note30" id="b30"><sup>30</sup></a> containing mighty bones, and a Buckler; What those large Urnes found at little <i>Massingham</i>,<a href="#note31" id="b31"><sup>31</sup></a> or why the <i>Angelsea</i> Urnes are placed with their mouths downward, remains yet undiscovered.</p>

			<p class="note"><a href="#b3" id="note3">3.</a> [The origin of the name Icen/Ecen is unclear. Why “Elbow”? Compare Camden, as englished by Philemon Holland:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p class="notenoindent">The region⁠ ⁠… which afterwards was called East-England⁠ ⁠… was inhabited in times past by the Iceni, called elsewhere amisse Tigeni: and in Ptolomee more corruptly Simeni: whom also I have thought heeretofore to have been in Cæsar by a confused name, termed Cenimagni: and so to thinke induced I was, partly by that most neere affinity betweene these names Iceni, and Cenimagni, and in part by the consent of Cæsar and Tacitus together. For Cæsar writeth that the Cenimagni yeelded themselves unto the Romans: which Tacitus recordeth that the Iceni likewise did, in these words: “They willingly joyned in amity with us.” But (that which maketh most to the cleering of this poynt) in a Manuscript old booke for Cenimagni, we finde written with the word divided in twaine, Ceni Agni. For which if I might not be thought some what too bould a Criticke, I owuld reade instead thereof Iceni, Regni. Neither verily can you finde the Cenimagni elsewhere in all Britain, if they be a diverse people from the Iceni and Regni. But of this name Iceni, there remains in this tract very many footings, if I may so tearme them, as <i>Ikensworth</i>, <i>Ikenthorpe</i>, <i>Ikbortow</i>, <i>Iken</i>, <i>Iksning</i>, <i>Ichlingham</i>, <i>Eike</i>, &amp;c. Yea and that high street-way, which went from hence, the Historians of the former age every where doe name <i>Ichenild-Street</i>, as one would say, <i>the Icenes street</i>.</p>
				<p class="noteindent">What should be the reason of this name (so love me Truth) I dare not guess, unlesse one would fetch it from the Wedge-like forme of the country, and say it lieth Wedgwise upon the Sea. For the Britans in their language call a Wedge <i>Iken</i>, and for the same cause a place in Wales, by the Lake or Meere <i>Lhintegid</i>, is of that forme named <i>Lhan-yken</i>, as Welsh-Britans enformed me: and in the very same sense a little country in Spaine (as Strabo writeth) is cleped Sphen, that is, The Wedge, and yet the same seemeth not to resemble a wedge so neere, as this of ours doth.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="noteindent">A note in Wilkin adds “But, unfortunately, <i>iken</i> does not signify an elbow: and it appears that the Iceni derived their name from the river Ouse, on whose banks they resided⁠—anciently called Iken, Yken, or Ycin. Whence also, Ikenild-street, Ikenthorpe, Ikenworth.” Unfortunately Wilkin gives no source for this information. The note also begs the question, as we are still left asking why the river is the Iken (though the origins of river names are notoriously difficult, they are still often traceable with work).]</p>

				<p class="notenoindent">When Ring heard that Harald was dead, he gave the signal to his men to break up their line and cease fighting. Then under cover of truce he made treaty with the enemy, telling them that it was vain to prolong the fray without their captain. Next he told the Swedes to look everywhere among the confused piles of carcases for the body of Harald, that the corpse of the king might not wrongfully lack its due rights. So the populace set eagerly to the task of turning over the bodies of the slain, and over this work half the day was spent. At last the body was found with the club, and he thought that propitiation should be made to the shade of Harald. So he harnessed the horse on which he rode to the chariot of the king, decked it honourably with a golden saddle, and hallowed it in his honour. Then he proclaimed his vows, and added his prayer that Harald would ride on this and outstrip those who shared his death in their journey to Tartarus; and that he would pray Pluto, the lord of Orcus, to grant a calm abode there for friend and foe. Then he raised a pyre, and bade the Danes fling on the gilded chariot of their king as fuel to the fire. And while the flames were burning the body cast upon them, he went round the mourning nobles and earnestly charged them that they should freely give arms, gold, and every precious thing to feed the pyre in honour of so great a king, who had deserved so nobly of them all. He also ordered that the ashes of his body, when it was quite burnt, should be transferred to an urn, taken to Leire, and there, together with the horse and armour, receive a royal funeral.</p>

			<p class="noteindent">Starkad or Starchaterus, according to Saxo and Olaus Magnus, was buried in the field or Reling or Roling (at the end of singularly unedifying career as “hero”) Johannes Magnus gives no detail on the fate of Starchaterus’ body.]</p>

The draught of them, such as it is, portrayed long since, heere I represent unto your view. For, without all forme and shape they bee, unequall, and by long continuance of time much impaired. The highest of them all, which without the circle looketh into the earth, they used to call <i>The King</i>, because hee should have beene King of English (forsooth) if hee had once seene <i>Long Compton</i>, a little Towne so called lying beneath, and which a man, if he goe some few paces forward, may see: other five standing at the other side, touching as it were, one another, they imagine to have been knightsmounted on horse backe; and the rest the Army.
