			<p class="noindent">That <i>Vulcan</i> gave arrows unto <i>Apollo</i> and <i>Diana</i> the fourth day after their Nativities, according to Gentile Theology,<a href="#note2" id="b2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> may passe for no blinde apprehension of the Creation of the Sunne and Moon, in the work of the fourth day; When the diffused light contracted into Orbes, <a id="page90">and</a> shooting rayes, of those Luminaries. Plainer Descriptions there are from Pagan pens, of the creatures of the fourth day; While the divine Philosopher<a href="#note3" id="b3"><sup>3</sup></a> unhappily omitteth the noblest part of the third; And <i>Ovid</i> (whom many conceive to have borrowed his description from <i>Moses</i>) coldly deserting the remarkable account of the text, in three words,<a href="#note4" id="b4"><sup>4</sup></a> describeth this work of the third day; the vegetable creation, and first ornamentall Scene of nature; the primitive food of animals, and first story of Physick, in Dietetical conservation.</p>
			<p class="indent">For though Physick may pleade high, from that medicall act of God, in casting so deep a sleep upon our first Parent; And Chirurgery<a href="#note5" id="b5"><sup>5</sup></a> finde its whole art, in that one passage concerning the Rib of <i>Adam</i>, yet is there no rivality with Garden contrivance and Herbery. For if Paradise were planted the third day of the Creation, as wiser Divinity concludeth, the Nativity thereof was too early for Horoscopie; Gardens were before Gardiners, and but some hours after the earth.<a href="#note6" id="b6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>
			<p class="indent"><a id="page91">Of</a> deeper doubt is its Topography, and locall designation, yet being the primitive garden, and without much<a href="#note7" id="b7"><sup>7</sup></a> controversie seated in the East; it is more then probable the first curiosity, and cultivation of plants, most flourished in those quarters. And since the Ark of <i>Noah</i> first toucht upon some mountains of <i>Armenia</i>, the planting art arose again in the East, and found its revolution not far from the place of its Nativity, about the Plains of those Regions. And if <i>Zoroaster</i> were either <i>Cham</i>, <i>Chus</i>, or <i>Mizraim</i>, they were early proficients therein, who left (as <i>Pliny</i> delivereth) a work of Agriculture.</p>
			<p class="indent">However the account of the Pensill or hanging gardens of<a href="#note8" id="b8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> <i>Babylon</i>, if made by <i>Semiramis</i>, the third or fourth from <i>Nimrod</i>, is of no slender antiquity; which being not framed upon ordinary levell of ground, but raised upon pillars, admitting under-passages, we cannot accept as the first <i>Babylonian</i> Gardens; But a more eminent progress and advancement in that art, then any that went before it: Somewhat answering or hinting the old Opinion concerning Paradise it self, with <a id="page92">many</a> conceptions elevated, above the plane of the Earth.<a href="#note9" id="b9"><sup>{9}</sup></a></p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Nebuchodnosor</i> whom some will have to be the famous <i>Syrian</i> king of <i>Diodorus</i>, beautifully repaired that City; and so magnificently built his<a href="#note10" id="b10"><sup>10</sup></a> hanging gardens; that from succeeding Writers he had the honour of the first. From whence over-looking <i>Babylon</i>, and all the region about it, he found no circumscription to the eye of his ambition, till over-delighted with the bravery of this Paradise; in his melancholy metamorphosis, he found the folly of that delight, and a proper punishment, in the contrary habitation, in wilde plantations and wanderings of the fields.</p>
			<p class="indent">The <i>Persian</i> Gallants who destroyed this Monarchy, maintained their Botanicall bravery. Unto whom we owe the very name of Paradise; wherewith we meet not in Scripture before the time of <i>Solomon</i>, and conceived originally <i>Persian</i>. The word for that disputed Garden, expressing in the Hebrew no more then a Field enclosed, which from the same Root is content to derive a garden and a Buckler.<a href="#note11a" id="b11a"><sup>[11a]</sup></a></p>
			<p class="indent"><a id="page93"><i>Cyrus</i></a> the elder brought up in Woods and Mountains, when time and power enabled, pursued the dictate of his education, and brought the treasures of the field into rule and circum-scription. So nobly beautifying the hanging Gardens of <i>Babylon</i>, that he was also thought to be the authour thereof.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Ahasuerus</i> (whom many conceive to have been <i>Artaxerxes Longi-manus</i>) in the Countrey and City of Flowers,<a href="#note11" id="b11"><sup>11</sup></a> and in an open Garden, entertained his Princes and people, while <i>Vashti</i> more modestly treated the Ladies within the Palace thereof.</p>
			<p class="indent">But if (as some opinion)<a href="#note12" id="b12"><sup>12</sup></a> King <i>Ahasuerus</i> were <i>Artaxerxes Mnemnon</i>, that found a life and reign answerable unto his great memory, our magnified <i>Cyrus</i> was his second Brother; who gave the occasion of that memorable work, and almost miraculous retrait of <i>Xenophon.</i><a href="#note13" id="b13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> A person of high spirit and honour, naturally a King, though fatally prevented by the harmlesse chance of <i>post</i>-geniture: Not only a Lord of Gardens, but a manuall planter thereof: disposing his trees like his armies in regular ordination. So <a id="page94">that</a> while old <i>Laertas</i> hath found a name in <i>Homer</i> for pruning hedges, and clearing away thorns and bryars; while King <i>Attalus</i> lives for his poysonous plantations of <i>Aconites</i>, Henbane, Hellebore, and plants hardly admitted within the walls of Paradise; While many of the Ancients do poorly live in the single names of Vegetables; All stories do look upon <i>Cyrus</i>, as the splendid and regular planter.</p>
			<p class="indent">According whereto <i>Xenophon</i><a href="#note14" id="b14"><sup>14</sup></a> describeth his gallant plantation at <i>Sardis</i>, thus rendred by <i>Strebæus</i>. <i>Arbores pari intervallo sitas, rectos ordines, &amp; omnia perpulchre in Quincuncem directa</i>.<a href="#note15" id="b15"><sup>15</sup></a> Which we shall take for granted as being accordingly rendred by the most elegant of the <i>Latines</i>;<a href="#note16" id="b16"><sup>16</sup></a> and by no made term, but in use before by <i>Varro</i>. That is the rows and orders so handsomely disposed; or five trees so set together, that a regular angularity, and through prospect, was left on every side, Owing this name not only unto the Quintuple number of Trees, but the figure declaring that number, which being doubled <!-- 1658: doubted --> at the angle, makes up the Letter χ, that is the <a id="p94">Emphaticall</a> decussation, or fundamentall figure.</p>
			<p class="indent">Now though in some ancient and modern practice the <i>area</i> or decussated plot, might be a perfect square, answerable to a <i>Tuscan Pedestall</i>, and the <i>Quinquernio</i> or Cinque-point of a dye; wherein by Diagonall lines the intersection was rectangular<a href="#note17" id="b17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>; accomodable unto Plantations of large growing Trees; and we must not deny our selves the advantage of this order; yet shall we chiefly insist upon that of <i>Curtius</i> and <i>Porta</i>,<a href="#note18" id="b18"><sup>18</sup></a> in their brief description hereof. Wherein the <i>decussis</i> is made within a longilaterall square, with opposite angles, acute and obtuse at the intersection; and so upon progression making a <i>Rhombus</i> or Lozenge figuration, which seemeth very agreeable unto the Originall figure; Answerable whereunto we observe the decussated characters in many consulary Coynes, and even in those of <i>Constantine</i> and his Sons, which pretend their pattern in the Sky; the crucigerous Ensigne carried this figure, not transversly<a href="#note19" id="b19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> or rectangularly intersected, but in a decussation, after the form of an <a id="page96"><i>Andrean</i></a> or <i>Burgundian</i> cross, which answereth this description.</p>
			<p class="indent">Where by the way we shall decline the old Theme, so traced by antiquity of crosses and crucifixion: Whereof some being right, and of one single peece without traversion or transome, do little advantage our subject. Nor shall we take in the mysticall <i>Tau</i>, or the Crosse of our blessed Saviour, which having in some descriptions an <i>Empedon</i> or crossing foot-stay, made not one single transversion. And since the Learned <i>Lipsius</i> hath made some doubt even of the Crosse of St <i>Andrew</i>, since some Martyrologicall Histories deliver his death by the generall Name of a crosse, and <i>Hippolitus</i> will have him suffer by the sword; we should have enough to make out the received Crosse of that Martyr. Nor shall we urge the <i>labarum</i>, and famous Standard of <i>Constantine</i>, or make further use thereof, then as the first Letters in the Name of our Saviour Christ, in use among Christians, before the dayes of <i>Constantine</i>, to be observed in Sepulchral Monuments of Martyrs,<a href="#note20" id="b20"><sup>20</sup></a> in the reign of <i>Adrian</i>, and <a id="page97"><i>Antoninus</i>;</a> and to be found in the Antiquities of the Gentiles, before the advent of Christ, as in the Medall of King <i>Ptolomy</i>, signed with the same characters, and might be the beginning of some word or name, which Antiquaries have not hit on.</p>
			<p class="indent">We will not revive the mysterious crosses of <i>ægypt</i>, with circles on their heads, in the breast of <i>Serapis</i>, and the hands of their Geniall spirits, not unlike the characters of <i>Venus</i>, and looked on by ancient Christians, with relation unto Christ. Since however they first began, the ægyptians thereby expressed the processe and motion of the spirit of the world, and the diffusion thereof upon the Celestiall and Elementall nature; implyed by a circle and right-lined intersection.<a href="#note21" id="b21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> A secret in their Telesmes and magicall Characters among them. Though he that considereth the plain crosse<a href="#note22" id="b22"><sup>22</sup></a> upon the head of the Owl in the Laterane Obelisk, or the crosse<a href="#note23" id="b23"><sup>23</sup></a> erected upon a picher diffusing streams of water into two basins, with sprinkling branches in them, and all described upon a two-footed Altar, as in the Hieroglyphics <a id="page98">of</a> the brasen Table of <i>Bembus;</i><a href="#note24" id="b24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> will hardly decline all thought of Christian signality in them.</p>
			<p class="indent"><a id="ox">We</a> shall not call in the Hebrew <i>Tenupha</i>, or ceremony of their Oblations, waved by the Priest unto the four quarters of the world, after the form of a cross; as in the peace-offerings. And if it were clearly made out what is remarkably delivered from the Traditions of the Rabbins, that as the Oyle was powred coronally or circularlly upon the head of Kings, so the High-Priest was anointed decussatively or in the form of a X; though it could not escape a typicall thought of Christ, from mysticall considerators; yet being the conceit is Hebrew, we should rather expect its verification from Analogy in that language, then to confine the same unto the unconcerned Letters of <i>Greece</i>, or make it out by the characters of <i>Cadmus</i> or <i>Palamedes.</i></p>
			<p class="indent">Of this Quincunciall Ordination the Ancients practised much discoursed little; and the Moderns have nothing enlarged; which he that more nearly considereth, in the form of its square <a id="page99"><i>Rhombus</i>,</a> and decussation, with the several commodities, mysteries, parallelismes, and resemblances, both in Art and Nature, shall easily discern the elegancy of this order.</p>
			<p class="indent">That this was in some wayes of practice in diverse and distant nations, hints or deliveries there are from no slender Antiquity. In the hanging Gardens of <i>Babylon</i>, from <i>Abydenus, Eusebius</i>, and others, <i>Curtius</i> describeth this Rule of decussation.<a href="#note25" id="b25"><sup>25</sup></a> In the memorable garden of <i>Alcinous</i> anciently conceived an originall phancy, from Paradise, mention there is of well contrived order; For so hath <i>Didymus</i> and <i>Eustachius</i> expounded the emphatical word. <i>Diomedes</i> describing the Rurall possessions of his father, gives account in the same Language of Trees orderly planted. And <i>Ulysses</i> being a boy was promised by his Father fourty Figge-trees, and fifty rows of Vines producing all kinde of grapes.<a href="#note26" id="b26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
			<p class="indent">That the Eastern Inhabitants of <i>India</i>, made use of such order, even in open Plantations, is deducible from <i>Theophrastus</i>; who describing the trees whereof they made their garments, plainly <a id="page100">delivereth</a> that they were planted κατ´ὄρχους,<a href="#note27" id="b27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> and in such order that at a distance men would mistake them for Vineyards. The same seems confirmed in <i>Greece</i> from a singular expression in <i>Aristotle</i><a href="#note28" id="b28"><sup>28</sup></a> concerning the order of Vines, delivered by a military term representing the orders of Souldiers, which also confirmeth the antiquity of this form yet used in vineall plantations.</p>
			<p class="indent">That the same was used in Latine plantations is plainly confirmed from the commending penne of <i>Varro</i>, <i>Quintilian</i>, and handsome Description of <i>Virgil</i>.<a href="#note29" id="b29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
			<p class="indent">That the first plantations not long after the Floud were disposed after this manner, the generality and antiquity of this order observed in Vineyards, and Wine plantations, affordeth some conjecture. And since from judicious enquiry, <i>Saturn</i> who divided the world between his three sonnes<a href="#note30" id="b30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>, who beareth a Sickle in his hand, who taught the plantations of Vines, the setting, grafting of trees, and the best part of Agriculture, is discovered to be <i>Noah</i>, whether this early dispersed Husbandry in <a id="page101">Vineyards,</a> had not its Originall in that Patriarch, is no such Paralogicall doubt.</p>
			<p class="indent">And if it were clear that this was used by <i>Noah</i> after the Floud, I could easily beleeve it was in use before it; Not willing to fix such ancient inventions no higher originall then <i>Noah;</i> Nor readily conceiving those aged <i>Heroes</i>, whose diet was vegetable, and only, or chiefly consisted in the fruits of the earth, were much deficient in their splendid cultivations; or after the experience of fifteen hundred years, left much for future discovery in Botanicall Agriculture. Nor fully perswaded that Wine was the invention of <i>Noah</i>, that fermented Liquors, which often make themselves, so long escaped their Luxury or experience; that the first sinne of the new world was no sin of the old. That <i>Cain</i> and <i>Abel</i> were the first that offered Sacrifice; or because the Scripture is silent that <i>Adam</i> or <i>Isaac</i> offered none at all.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whether <i>Abraham</i> brought up in the first planting Countrey, observed not some rule hereof, when he planted a <a id="paeg102">grove</a> at <i>Beer-sheba</i>; or whether at least a like ordination were not in the Garden of <i>Solomon</i>, probability may contest. Answerably unto the wisedom of that eminent Botanologer, and orderly disposer of all his other works. Especially since this was one peece of Gallantry, wherein he pursued the specious part of felicity, according to his own description. I made me Gardens and Orchards, and planted Trees in them of all kindes of fruit. I made me Pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth Trees,<a href="#note31" id="b31"><sup>31</sup></a> which was no ordinary plantation, if according to the <i>Targam</i>, or <i>Chaldee Paraphrase</i>, it contained all kindes of Plants, and some fetched as far as <i>India</i>; And the extent thereof were from the wall of <i>Jerusalem</i> unto the water of <i>Siloah</i>.</p>
			<p class="indent">And if <i>Jordan</i> were but <i>Jaar Eden</i>, that is, the River of <i>Eden</i>, <i>Genesar</i> but <i>Gansar</i> or the Prince of Gardens; and it could be made out, that the Plain of <i>Jordan</i> were watered not comparatively, but causally, and because it was the Paradise of God, as the Learned <i>Abramas</i><a href="#note32" id="b32"><sup>32</sup></a> hinteth, he was not far from the Prototype <a id="page103">and</a> originall of Plantations. And since even in Paradise it self, the tree of knowledge was placed in the middle of the Garden, whatever was the ambient figure, there wanted not a centre and rule of decussation. Whether the groves and sacred Plantations of Antiquity, were not thus orderly placed, either by <i>quaternio’s</i>, or quintuple ordinations, may favourably be doubted. For since they were so methodicall in the constitutions of their temples, as to observe the due scituation, aspect, manner, form, and order in Architectonicall relations, whether they were not as distinct in their groves and Plantations about them, in form and <i>species</i> respectively unto their Deities, is not without probability of conjecture. And in their groves of the Sunne this was a fit number, by multiplication to denote the dayes of the year; and might Hieroglyphically speak as much, as the mysticall <i>Statua</i> of <i>Janus</i><a href="#note33" id="b33"><sup>33</sup></a><i> </i>in the Language of his fingers. And since they were so criticall in the number of his horses, the strings of his Harp, and rayes about his head, denoting the orbes of heaven, the Seasons and Moneths of the Yeare; witty Idolatry would hardly be flat in other appropriations.</p>

In this excepted, we know not whether the ancient gardens do equal those of late times, or those at present in Europe. Of the gardens of Herperies, we know nothing singular, but some golden apples. Of Alcinous his garden, we read nothing beyond figgs, apples, and olives; if we allow it to be any more than a fiction of Homer, unhappily placed in Corfu, where the sterility of the soil makes men believe there was no such thing at all. The gardens of Adonis were so empty that they afforded proverbial expression, and the principal part thereof was empty spaces, with herbs and flowers in pots. I think we little understand the pensile gardens of Semiramis, which made one of the wonders of it, wherein probably the structure exceeded the plants contained in them. The excellency thereof was probably in the trees, and if the descension of the roots be equal to the height of trees, it was not [absurd] of Strebæus to think the pillars were hollow that the roots might shoot into them.”}</p>
